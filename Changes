- ver 0.3.0.0
 * Updated API:
   + InterpreterT monad transformer (Interpreter = InterpreterT IO)
   + No more Sessions, use runInterpreter only once
   + New options handling functions
     - but observe that there is no setOptimizations equivalent;
       since GHC does no optimization on interpreted code, this was actually
       doing nothing
 * Works with GHC 6.10 and 6.8 (untested with 6.6)

- ver 0.2.5
 * setImportsQ added (modules can be imported both qualified and unqualified)

- ver 0.2.4.1
 * BUGFIX: No longer fails on expressions ending in a -- comment

- ver 0.2.4
 * setInstalledModsAreInScopeQualified added
 * Now depends on ghc-paths (no longer needs a custom cabal script)

- ver 0.2.2
 * setOptimizations added
 * Module Language.Haskell.Interpreter.GHC.Unsafe added
   (contains unsafeSetGhcOption)
 * unit tests now based on HUnit

- ver 0.2.1
 * BUGFIX: Module reloading was broken under 6.8
 * GHC.GhcExceptions are catched and turned into InterpreterErrors

- ver 0.2.0.1
 * Adds the requirement cabal-version < 1.3

- ver 0.2

 * Works also with GHC 6.8 and 6.6
 * Added the getModuleExports function
 * withSession function throws a dynamic exception instead of returning Either Error a
 * Requires Cabal 1.2.x
